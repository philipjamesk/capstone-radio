# Raspberry Pi Internet Radio

This is the python code for my Raspberry Pi internet radio that I am building for as the project for DGMD E-599 at Harvard Extension School.

## TODO
* Link Complete Build
* Link Code Directory


### Required
* vlc
* python-vlc
* pygame

### NOTICE
Because of I am unsure of the copyright/trademark rules around having radio station logos as part of the source code for this project they have been removed from the repository. The code assumes they are stored in a folder called `img/logos/` if a logo is missing or otherwise unavailable, the logo.py class will dynamically create an image using the name of the station stored in the stations.json file.
