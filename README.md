# Raspberry Pi Internet Radio

This is the python code for my Raspberry Pi internet radio that I am building for as the project for DGMD E-599 at Harvard Extension School.

### Required
* vlc
* python-vlc
* pygame
* wxPython

### TODO
* master class launches radio and edit_list
* check address to valid web address
* station_list.py should relaunch radio.py
* file picker for adding logo
